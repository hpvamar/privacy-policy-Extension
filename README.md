# Privacy Policy

This Chrome extension is a productivity tool that allows the user to extract visible text from a webpage and process it using an AI service, only when the user triggers the extension.

## Data Collection
The extension may temporarily read visible content from the currently active webpage when the user chooses to use the extension. It may also store the user's provided API key and license code locally in the browser so the extension can function.

## Data Usage
All data is used only to provide the extension’s intended functionality.  
No user data is sold, shared, or transferred to third parties.

## Data Storage
All stored information remains locally in the user's browser. Data is only sent to an external AI API when the user explicitly triggers the extension.
